# TASK DESCRIPTION :
# Project Title:
Expense Tracker App with Categorization, Charts, and Data Persistence

# Description:
This project involves the development of a simple and user-friendly Android mobile application that helps users to track their daily expenses, categorize them, and view a visual summary using charts. The app is designed to make personal finance management easy and organized.

The core idea of this app is to allow users to enter their expenses, group them into categories such as Food, Transport, Shopping, Utilities, etc., and store this data locally using Room (a modern database library built on top of SQLite) or directly using SQLite. This ensures that the user's data is saved on the device and is available even after the app is closed or the phone is restarted.

Users can add, update, and delete expense records. Each expense entry includes fields such as amount, description, category, and date. The app displays all recorded expenses in a structured list format and provides an overall summary screen where users can see how much theyâ€™ve spent in each category.

To help users understand their spending habits better, the app features visualizations using pie charts and bar charts. These charts clearly show which category has the most spending and help users make better financial decisions.

The app follows a clean and modular architecture using MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern. This ensures that the code is easy to maintain and scale. The app also uses RecyclerView to display the list of expenses and MPAndroidChart or a similar library to show graphical charts.

In summary, this project is a complete Android application that:

Helps users track expenses easily

Categorizes spending for better organization

Shows summary and insights using charts

Stores data persistently using Room or SQLite

Works offline and is suitable for day-to-day use

This app can be a valuable tool for anyone who wants to manage their money better by tracking where and how they spend it.
